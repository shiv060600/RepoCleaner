Made this code to practice C++, would normally implement in python.

realized that when porting files/codebases from mac to windows my dirs and subdirs/files all started with ._ , but also included a copy of the normally named file. I made this code  to recursively remove any of those files, and leave the rest untouched/handle errors.
